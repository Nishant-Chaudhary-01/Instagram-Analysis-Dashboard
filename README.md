## Tools and Technologies
- Tableau for data visualization
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and preparation

## Data Source and File Handling

The dataset was originally in CSV format and used directly in Tableau for building the dashboard.
Data cleaning (e.g., removing duplicates, standardizing fields) was done within the CSV before visualization.
Tableau was used to create interactive charts highlighting influencer performance across categories and regions.
For GitHub documentation, the CSV was converted to Excel (.xlsx) to ensure better file organization and accessibility.

## Process
- Imported the original CSV dataset into Excel for formatting and cleanup.
- Cleaned data by removing duplicates, standardizing categories, and formatting numeric fields.
- Used Tableau to visualize key metrics like engagement trends, top influencers, and category-wise performance.
- Designed the dashboard to support brands in selecting the most effective influencers for campaign promotion.
